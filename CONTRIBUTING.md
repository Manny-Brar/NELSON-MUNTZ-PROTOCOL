# Contributing to Nelson Muntz Protocol

> *"Who hath summoned me?"* — You, apparently. Let's see what you got.

## So You Wanna Help?

Fine. But we do things MY way around here. Follow the rules or get beat up (metaphorically).

---

## How To Contribute

### 1. Found a Bug? 🔴

Open an issue. Include:
- What you were trying to do
- What happened instead
- Error messages (the whole thing, not just "it didn't work")
- Your setup (OS, Claude Code version)

**Don't:** Open an issue that just says "it's broken." That's lazy. I don't respect lazy.

### 2. Got an Idea? 💡

Open an issue first. Describe:
- What you want to add
- Why it's useful
- How it fits the Nelson philosophy (fresh context, single focus, etc.)

**Don't:** Just submit a PR without talking first. I might not want your "improvement."

### 3. Want to Submit Code? 🥊

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-thing`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test it (I will check)
5. Submit a PR with a clear description

## Code Standards

### Keep It Simple

- No over-engineering
- If it works, don't make it "elegant"
- Comments only where actually needed

### Follow the Patterns

- Look at existing code
- Match the style
- Don't reinvent what's already there

### Test Your Stuff

- Run the scripts
- Make sure nothing breaks
- If you add features, show me they work

## What I'll Accept

✅ Bug fixes (always welcome)
✅ Documentation improvements (typos, clarity)
✅ New skills that follow the pattern
✅ Performance improvements (with proof)
✅ Better error messages

## What I Won't Accept

❌ Breaking changes without discussion
❌ "Refactoring" that doesn't improve anything
❌ Adding dependencies we don't need
❌ Changing the core philosophy
❌ Sloppy code with no testing

---

## The Review Process

1. I'll look at your PR
2. I might ask questions
3. I might request changes
4. If it's good, it gets merged
5. If it's not, I'll tell you why

**Don't take it personally.** I'm tough on everyone. That's why this thing works.

## Questions?

Open an issue. Don't DM me on random platforms.

*"Others try. We triumph. HA-HA!"* 🥊

Now go make something useful.
