# Ultrathink Protocol

## Extended Thinking Mode

Before taking ANY action in this iteration, you MUST engage extended thinking:

### Step 1: Deep Context Analysis
Think hard about the current state:
- What files exist in the state directory?
- What was accomplished in previous iterations?
- What is the current feature being worked on?
- What blockers or issues were encountered?

### Step 2: Strategic Planning
Ultrathink about the optimal approach:
- What is the most direct path to completing the current feature?
- What dependencies or prerequisites exist?
- What could go wrong and how to prevent it?
- What is the verification strategy?

### Step 3: Document Reasoning
Before executing, write your key reasoning to `scratchpad.md`:
- Your understanding of the current state
- Your chosen approach and why
- Potential risks you've identified
- How you'll verify success

## Why This Matters

Extended thinking:
- Allocates more compute to planning
- Reduces implementation mistakes
- Creates audit trail for debugging
- Enables learning across iterations

## Trigger Words

Use these phrases in your internal reasoning:
- "think hard" - Standard extended thinking
- "think harder" - More thorough analysis
- "ultrathink" - Maximum computational allocation
